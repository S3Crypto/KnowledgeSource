# Learning Path: Microservices Architecture with C# and .NET

This learning path guides you through understanding, designing, implementing, and operating microservices using C# and .NET. It progresses from foundational concepts to advanced implementation strategies, with practical examples throughout.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this learning path, you should have:

- Solid understanding of C# programming language
- Familiarity with ASP.NET Core basics
- Experience with web API development
- Basic understanding of database concepts
- Knowledge of containerization concepts (Docker basics)

## Path Overview

1. **Foundations** - Understanding microservices concepts
2. **Design** - Architecting microservice-based applications
3. **Implementation** - Building microservices with .NET
4. **Integration** - Connecting microservices
5. **Deployment** - Containerization and orchestration
6. **Operations** - Monitoring, scaling, and resilience

## Stage 1: Foundations (2-3 days)

Start with the core concepts of microservices architecture:
