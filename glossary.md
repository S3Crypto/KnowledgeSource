# C# and .NET Glossary

A comprehensive reference of terminology used throughout this knowledge repository.

## A

### Abstract Class
A class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be a base class for other classes. Abstract classes can contain both implemented methods and abstract methods that derived classes must implement.

### Accessibility Modifiers
Keywords that define the accessibility level of types and type members: `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `protected internal`.

### Async/Await
Language features that simplify asynchronous programming by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.

### Assembly
A compiled unit of deployment and versioning for a .NET application, typically a DLL or EXE file.

## B

### Boxing
The process of converting a value type to a reference type by wrapping the value within an object instance.

## C

### C# (C-Sharp)
A modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET initiative.

### CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
A specification that describes the executable code and runtime environment that form the core of the .NET framework.

### CLR (Common Language Runtime)
The virtual machine component of the .NET framework that manages the execution of .NET programs.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
An architectural pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store.

## D

### Delegate
A type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.

### Dependency Injection
A design pattern used to implement IoC, where the creation and binding of dependent objects is delegated to a separate component.

### Dispose Pattern
A pattern for releasing unmanaged resources in a consistent manner.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Objects that carry data between processes or service boundaries.

## E

### Entity Framework
Microsoft's object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.

### Event
A notification sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action.

### Extension Method
A method that adds functionality to an existing type without modifying the type itself.

## F

### Finalizer
A special method (also known as a destructor) that is called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed.

### Functional Programming
A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

## G

### Garbage Collection
The automatic memory management feature of .NET that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

### Generics
A feature that allows the creation of classes, methods, and interfaces that have placeholder types.

## I

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
The practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.

### IL (Intermediate Language)
A CPU-independent instruction set that .NET code is compiled into before being compiled to native code at runtime.

### Interface
A contract that specifies a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.

### IoC (Inversion of Control)
A design principle in which custom-written portions of a program receive the flow of control from a generic framework.

## J

### JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation
The process of converting IL code to native machine code at runtime.

## L

### LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
A set of features that extends query capabilities to the .NET languages.

### Lambda Expression
An anonymous function that can be used to create delegates or expression tree types.

## M

### Middleware
Software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses.

### Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services.

### Moq
A popular mocking framework for .NET.

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
A design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.

## N

### Namespace
A hierarchical organization of types to prevent name collisions and to control assembly scope.

### Nuget
The package manager for .NET that enables developers to create, share, and consume useful code.

## O

### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that can contain data and code.

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
A technique that converts data between incompatible type systems in relational databases and object-oriented programming languages.

## P

### Polymorphism
The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
A category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.

## R

### Reflection
The ability of a program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems, commonly used for web APIs.

## S

### Serialization
The process of converting an object into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission.

### SOLID Principles
Five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### SPA (Single Page Application)
A web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.

### Swagger/OpenAPI
A specification and set of tools for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

## T

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
A software development process where tests are written before the code they are testing.

### Task
A class that represents an asynchronous operation in .NET.

### Tuple
A data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types.

## U

### Unboxing
The process of converting an object instance (previously boxed) to a value type.

## V

### Value Type
A type that contains the data within its own memory allocation (stored on the stack rather than the heap).

### Virtual Method
A method that can be overridden in a derived class.

## W

### Web API
An API that can be accessed over the web using HTTP protocols.

### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
An XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages.

## X

### XUnit
A free, open-source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework.

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
