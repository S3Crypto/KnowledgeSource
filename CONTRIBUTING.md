- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use code blocks with language specifiers (e.g., ```csharp)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately
- Include diagrams when beneficial (using Mermaid or PlantUML)

### Code Examples

- All code should be syntactically correct and follow C# coding conventions
- Include comments to explain complex logic
- Keep examples concise and focused on the topic
- Avoid platform-specific code unless necessary for the topic
- Ensure examples are complete enough to illustrate the concept
